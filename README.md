# Arduino_ESP32
Small project I made using a virtual and real model of an ESP32.
The project consists of steps, each one of them showcasing the capabilities of the ESP32, an easy to use and program system.
The first steps were completed using the Wokwi Arduino Simulator(https://wokwi.com/) and later on it's real life version in the last steps of the project.
